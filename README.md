A Dependent Haskell Triptych
----------------------------

This repo contains the code and slides used in Richard Eisenberg's
2016 Haskell Implementors' Workshop talk. This talk includes a
demonstration of three programs that use new features of GHC/Haskell,
in the directories of the repo.

Note that this repo has submodules, so use `git clone --recursive` or
`git submodule update --init`.
